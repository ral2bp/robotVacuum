# robotVacuum
Friends assignment for a job interview, started implementing it in C++ for fun.

Basically have to have a room with some obstacles, and program a robot vacuum to traverse all of it.

Looks beautiful in the ASCII art I decided to use, but you'll have to download and build it to experience it.
